# EStore
[HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, MVC] An ECommerce Store using only native HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and JQuery and integrates several previous projects
from my other repositories such as MVC Architecture, RestAPI & EthWallet

This Responsive ECommerce Web Store was built using basic web languages to allow users to buy, sell products and order services
It has ECommerce functionality using Vanilla Javascript and Local Storage so that users do not need to login in order to browse products
and add products to the cart. What makes it unique is the potential of integration this with the EthWallet Blockchain wallet which will
remove the need for a payment gateway to provide fast and secure online payments where users can feel safe without entering their banking details.
It integrates the custom built MVC Architecture and the custom built RestAPI to achieve this
No frameworks were used to make it lightweight and simple to use and to explore the capabiliteis of the basic native languages

Technologies:
Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL

Frameworks & Libraries: JQuery

Architecture: MVC, RestAPI
